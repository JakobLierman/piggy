<h1 align="center">Piggy</h1>

Piggy is a small application that allows you to keep track of your savings goals. The application makes an overview of the current goals, how much you have already saved and when the deadline is.

There is also a handy calculator to calculate things related to savings.

Created as a proof-of-concept application for onboarding and help elements. Used in usability tests. Read all about is [here](https://github.com/JakobLierman/bachelorproef-hogent-1920) (Dutch).
